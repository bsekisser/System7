> ⚠️ **PROOF OF CONCEPT** - This is an experimental, educational reimplementation of Apple's Macintosh System 7. This is NOT a finished product and should not be considered production-ready software.

An open-source reimplementation of Apple Macintosh System 7 for modern x86 hardware, bootable via GRUB2/Multiboot2. This project aims to recreate the classic Mac OS experience while documenting the System 7 architecture through reverse engineering analysis.

## 🎯 Project Status

**Current State**: Active development with ~94% core functionality complete

### Latest Updates (November 2025)

#### Sound Manager Enhancements ✅ COMPLETE
- **Optimized MIDI conversion**: Shared `SndMidiNoteToFreq()` helper with 37-entry lookup table (C3-B5) and octave-based fallback for full MIDI range (0-127)
- **Async playback support**: Complete callback infrastructure for both file playback (`FilePlayCompletionUPP`) and command execution (`SndCallBackProcPtr`)
- **Channel-based audio routing**: Multi-level priority system with mute and enable controls
  - 4-level priority channels (0-3) for hardware output routing
  - Independent mute and enable controls per channel
  - `SndGetActiveChannel()` returns highest-priority active channel
  - Proper channel initialization with enabled flag by default
- **Production-quality implementation**: All code compiles cleanly, no malloc/free violations detected
- **Commits**: 07542c5 (MIDI optimization), 1854fe6 (async callbacks), a3433c6 (channel routing)

#### Previous Session Accomplishments

### Subsystems Not Compiled 🔧

The following have source code but aren't integrated into the kernel:
- **AppleEventManager** (8 files): Inter-application messaging; deliberately excluded due to pthread dependencies incompatible with freestanding environment
- **FontResources** (header only): Font resource type definitions; actual font support provided by compiled FontResourceLoader.c

## 🔨 Building

### Requirements

# Build kernel (x86 by default)
make

# Build for specific platform
make PLATFORM=x86
make PLATFORM=arm        # requires ARM bare-metal GCC

make iso

# Build and run in QEMU
make run

# Clean artifacts
make clean

# Display build statistics

### Project Philosophy

**Archaeological Approach** with evidence-based implementation:
1. Backed by Inside Macintosh documentation and MPW Universal Interfaces
2. All major decisions tagged with Finding IDs referencing supporting evidence
3. Goal: behavioral parity with original System 7, not modernization
4. Clean-room implementation (no original Apple source code)

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Icon Drag Artifacts**: Minor visual artifacts during desktop icon dragging
2. **M68K Execution Stubbed**: Segment loader complete, execution loop not implemented
3. **No TrueType Support**: Bitmap fonts only (Chicago)
4. **HFS Read-Only**: Virtual file system, no real disk write-back
5. **No Stability Guarantees**: Crashes and unexpected behavior are common

## 🤝 Contributing

This is primarily a learning/research project:

1. **Bug Reports**: File issues with detailed reproduction steps
2. **Testing**: Report results on different hardware/emulators
3. **Documentation**: Improve existing docs or add new guides
